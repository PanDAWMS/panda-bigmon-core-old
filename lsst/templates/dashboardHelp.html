        <b>Region view</b><br>
        This view associates jobs with clouds on the basis of the region in which the processing site is located.
        The alternative <a href="{% url 'dashProduction' %}">'cloud' view</a> associates jobs with clouds on the basis of which Tier 1 the job is assigned to (which can be different for a site participating in multi-cloud production).
        Click the cloud name in the overall summary to go to the cloud's site summary.
        Click the job counts to go to job listings.

        {% elif cloudview == 'cloud' %}

        <b>Cloud view</b><br>
        This view associates jobs with clouds on the basis of which Tier 1 the job is assigned to, which can be different from the 'home cloud' of the processing site for a site participating in multi-cloud production (MCP). Thus in this view you may see sites listed in the CA cloud which are not located in CA.
        The alternative <a href="{% url 'dashProduction' %}?cloudview=region">'region' view</a> associates production jobs with clouds on the basis of the region in which the processing site is located.
        Click the cloud name in the overall summary to go to the cloud's site summary.

        {% endif %}

    {% elif view == 'analysis' %}

    Click the cloud name in the overall summary to go to the cloud's site summary.

Pilot counts (nPilots) are for the last 3 hours. They are only shown in region view (they only make sense in that view, they are regional by nature).

{% elif mode == 'task' %}

Task names are only shown for JEDI tasks at the moment.
