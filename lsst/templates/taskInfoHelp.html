<p>
The task status shown is the simple 'macro' state the task is in -- the 'superstatus' field in the task record. In ATLAS, these are in sync with DEFT states. JEDI uses internally a more complex set of states, the 'status' field, shown here as 'Detailed JEDI status'.
</p>

<p>
Finished/failed progress of the task is indicated by the percentage and counts of input files that are finished/failed.
Click on the failed file percentage or count to see a summary of the errors.
</p>
<p>
(In the new JEDI system, task progress cannot be monitored in terms of jobs completed/failed because jobs are defined dynamically. The input files associated with a task are an invariant of the task, so measuring their progress is a valid metric of task progress.)
