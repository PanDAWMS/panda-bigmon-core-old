<p>
PanDA's JEDI file information records the processing status and history of a file (as well as its static parameters). A file may be used many times, if different jobs are assigned different event ranges in the file to process, and/or if a job fails and is retried.
</p>

<p>
Any given file can appear multiple times within a JEDI dataset. Each entry corresponds to a distinct processing of the file, associated with a particular PanDA job and attempt number.
