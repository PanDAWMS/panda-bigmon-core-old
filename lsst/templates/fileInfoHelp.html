PanDA's JEDI file information records the processing status and history of a file (as well as its static parameters). 'Occurrences' of a file are usages of the file in processing. A file may be used many times, if different jobs are assigned different event ranges in the file to process (in which case firstevent and endevent record the assigned range), and/or if a job fails and is retried.
